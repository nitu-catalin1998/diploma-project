WEBVTT - Demo

00:15.000 --> 00:25.000
Data set loading and tokenization.


00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
Training starts.


00:40.000 --> 01:00.000
Training loop: several epochs, each epoch has several training batches on which the training step is made and several test batches on which the test step is made.


01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
For each epoch, the loss and accuracy are calculated, as well as the running time.


01:10.000 --> 01:50.000
Graphics are made during training. The graphs show real-time changes in accuracy and loss.


01:55.000 --> 02:05.000
Every fifth epoch a checkpoint is made to save the trained model.


02:10.000 --> 02:55.000
Training for 100 epochs.


03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
The training is over.


03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
An epoch for evaluation.

03:10.000 --> 03:25.000
Examples of correction.


03:27.000 --> 03:28.500
Calculation of the BLEU score (interruption after 5 examples from the validation data set, approximately 2 hours).


03:29.000 --> 03:29.999
Saving checkpoints and logs for graphs.


03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Thanks!
